            <li><h3>Reddit AI</h3></li>
                <p>
                    In a project sponsored by the University of Vermont, worked on a set of programs written in Python
                    with the purpose of tracking user-created content on the popular website: “Reddit.” In addition to
                    the Python backbone, the programs used a variety of cloud services to power the AI functionality
                    that enabled the creation of a conversational agent that interacted with users of Reddit. These
                    programs were used to identify and attempt to increase levels of awareness about the humanitarian
                    crisis in Puerto Rico caused by the hurricane “Maria” in 2017.

            <li><h3>Datamine</h3></li>
                <p>
                    A set of Python programs that work to collect, clean, and analyze data from the site “Reddit.” The
                    programs allow for the creation of a pipeline from raw to actionable data, making use of the Pandas
                    Python library to do data science.

            <li><h3>Star Wars ML</h3></li>
                <p>
                    An android application that allows users to identify which “Star-Wars” character a given Twitter
                    user is mostly related to. For this group project, I created the machine learning core, collecting
                    the data and designing the model that used a stochastic gradient descent classifier.
                </p>

            <li><h3>Accounter</h3>
                <p>
                    Accounter is an application for tracking important appointments with clients. The application was
                    originally designed for use in law practices, but can be used by anyone needing to track events
                    related to people, organizations, or corporations. The first version was created with Java and
                    JavaFX, and it was later implemented in Swift with UIKit.
                </p>

            <li><h3>Risk</h3></li>
                <p>
                    An implementation of the board game Risk. The current version only supports Human VS Computer play,
                    but its base was developed so that it might be easily ready for implementation of online multiplayer.
