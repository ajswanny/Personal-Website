                    <p>
                        In a project sponsored by the University of Vermont, worked on a set of programs written in Python
                        with the purpose of tracking user-created content on the popular website: “Reddit.” In addition to
                        the Python backbone, the programs used a variety of cloud services to power the AI functionality
                        that enabled the creation of a conversational agent that interacted with users of Reddit. These
                        programs were used to identify and attempt to increase levels of awareness about the humanitarian
                        crisis in Puerto Rico caused by the hurricane “Maria” in 2017.

                        A set of Python programs that work to collect, clean, and analyze data from the site “Reddit.” The
                        programs allow for the creation of a pipeline from raw to actionable data, making use of the Pandas
                        Python library to do data science.

                        An android application that allows users to identify which “Star-Wars” character a given Twitter
                        user is mostly related to. For this group project, I created the machine learning core, collecting
                        the data and designing the model that used a stochastic gradient descent classifier.

                        Accounter is an application for tracking important appointments with clients. The application was
                        originally designed for use in law practices, but can be used by anyone needing to track events
                        related to people, organizations, or corporations. The first version was created with Java and
                        JavaFX, and it was later implemented in Swift with UIKit.
