                <p>
                    In a project sponsored by the University of Vermont, worked on a set of programs written in Python with the purpose of tracking user-created content on the popular website: “Reddit.” In addition to the Python backbone, the programs used a variety of cloud services to power the AI functionalities that enabled the creation of a conversational agent that interacted with users of Reddit. These programs were used to identify and attempt to increase levels of awareness about the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico caused by the hurricane “Maria” in 2017.

            <li><a href="https://github.com/ajswanny/Datamine">Datamine</a></li>
                <p>
                    A set of Python programs that work to collect, clean, and analyze data from the site “Reddit.” The programs allow for the creation of a pipeline from raw to actionable data, making use of the Pandas Python library to do data science.
                </p>
            <li>Star-Wars ML</li>
                <p>
                    An android application that allows users to identify which “Star-Wars” character a given Twitter user is mostly related to. For this group project, I created the machine learning core, collecting the data and designing the model that used a stochastic gradient descent classifier.
